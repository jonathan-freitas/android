Coding

Hello fellow human being! The majority of my codes are documented in Brazilian Portuguese, but if you take some interest in any of them, for your work or study, share with me your questions at: frejonathann@gmail.com

I'm also looking for any kind of professional experience, I would be glad to help in any project of sorts. My area of expertise includes:

Java (Junior); C++ (Manipulating Pixels); Android (Both xml and java, Junior);

If you wish to talk to me, my e-mail follows: frejonathann@gmail.com

So.. that's it! Bye! \o
